## Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment (optional)

> Doing this ensures everyone has the same environment.

1. Open a terminal in the **project root**.

2. Create the virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


3. Activate the virtual environment:

* **Windows:**

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Mac/Linux:**

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. In VS Code, switch the notebook kernel to the virtual environment (`venv`) using the top right corner of the notebook.
